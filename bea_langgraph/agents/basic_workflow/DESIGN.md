# Basic Workflow Design

## Architecture Overview
```
Input -> Generation -> Review -> Revision -> Output

Components:
- Generator: Creates initial document based on criteria
- Reviewer: Analyzes document quality and provides feedback
- Reviser: Improves document based on feedback
```

## Design Decisions

1. Streaming Response Processing
   - Choice: Process responses in chunks with think tag handling
   - Rationale: Enables real-time feedback and progress monitoring
   - Benefits: Better user experience, early error detection
   - Trade-offs: More complex implementation, needs careful error handling

2. State Management
   - Choice: Immutable state with history tracking
   - Rationale: Maintains clear document evolution
   - Benefits: Easy debugging, audit trail, rollback capability
   - Trade-offs: Higher memory usage, potential performance impact

3. Error Handling Strategy
   - Choice: Graceful degradation with partial results
   - Rationale: Better to return partial success than total failure
   - Benefits: Improved reliability, user satisfaction
   - Trade-offs: May need manual intervention for incomplete results

## Integration Points

1. Model Context Protocol Integration
   - Standardized message formats
   - Consistent think tag processing
   - Clear error state handling
   - Tool-based interaction support

2. External System Integration
   - Document storage systems
   - Version control integration
   - Authentication systems
   - Monitoring and logging

## Trade-offs

1. Simplicity vs Flexibility
   - Chose simple sequential workflow
   - Benefits: Easy to understand and maintain
   - Drawbacks: Less flexible for complex workflows
   - Mitigation: Extensible design allows adding complexity when needed

2. Synchronous vs Asynchronous
   - Chose asynchronous processing
   - Benefits: Better resource utilization, non-blocking
   - Drawbacks: More complex error handling
   - Mitigation: Clear async patterns and timeout handling

3. Validation Approach
   - Chose runtime validation
   - Benefits: Immediate feedback, clear errors
   - Drawbacks: Performance impact
   - Mitigation: Optimized validation rules

## Future Considerations

1. Scalability
   - Parallel processing support
   - Distributed workflow handling
   - Load balancing strategies

2. Monitoring
   - Performance metrics
   - Error tracking
   - Usage analytics

3. Security
   - Access control
   - Data encryption
   - Audit logging
