# Document Generation Design

## Architecture Overview
```
Input -> Generator -> Content Processing -> Output

Components:
- Generator: Creates content based on criteria
- Processor: Handles streaming and think tags
- Validator: Ensures content quality
```

## Design Decisions

1. Content Generation
   - Choice: Streaming generation with think tag processing
   - Rationale: Better user feedback and control
   - Benefits: Real-time progress updates
   - Trade-offs: More complex implementation

2. Validation Strategy
   - Choice: Runtime content validation
   - Rationale: Immediate quality feedback
   - Benefits: Early error detection
   - Trade-offs: Performance impact

3. Error Recovery
   - Choice: Partial content preservation
   - Rationale: Better than complete failure
   - Benefits: Saves partial work
   - Trade-offs: May need manual review

## Integration Points

1. Model Context Protocol
   - Standardized message formats
   - Think tag processing
   - Error state handling
   - Tool integration support

2. External Systems
   - Document storage
   - Version control
   - Content validation
   - Format conversion

## Trade-offs

1. Generation Approach
   - Chose streaming over batch
   - Benefits: Better feedback, control
   - Drawbacks: More complex handling
   - Mitigation: Clear streaming patterns

2. Content Processing
   - Chose runtime processing
   - Benefits: Immediate validation
   - Drawbacks: Performance overhead
   - Mitigation: Optimized validation

3. State Management
   - Chose immutable state
   - Benefits: Clear history, debugging
   - Drawbacks: Memory usage
   - Mitigation: State cleanup

## Future Considerations

1. Performance
   - Batch processing option
   - Content caching
   - Validation optimization

2. Features
   - Template support
   - Format conversion
   - Multi-document handling

3. Integration
   - External storage
   - Version control
   - Format standards
