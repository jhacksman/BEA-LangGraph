# Content Revision Design

## Architecture Overview
```
Input -> Reviewer -> Reviser -> Version Control -> Output

Components:
- Reviewer: Analyzes content quality
- Reviser: Improves content based on feedback
- Version Control: Tracks content history
```

## Design Decisions

1. Revision Strategy
   - Choice: Iterative improvement with feedback
   - Rationale: Better quality control
   - Benefits: Clear improvement tracking
   - Trade-offs: Multiple API calls

2. Version Control
   - Choice: Complete history tracking
   - Rationale: Audit and rollback support
   - Benefits: Clear content evolution
   - Trade-offs: Memory usage

3. Feedback Processing
   - Choice: Structured feedback format
   - Rationale: Consistent improvements
   - Benefits: Clear revision goals
   - Trade-offs: More rigid structure

## Integration Points

1. Model Context Protocol
   - Standardized message formats
   - Think tag processing
   - Error state handling
   - Tool integration support

2. External Systems
   - Version control
   - Content storage
   - Quality metrics
   - Format conversion

## Trade-offs

1. Revision Approach
   - Chose iterative over batch
   - Benefits: Better control, tracking
   - Drawbacks: More API calls
   - Mitigation: Efficient batching

2. History Management
   - Chose complete history
   - Benefits: Full audit trail
   - Drawbacks: Memory usage
   - Mitigation: Cleanup options

3. Feedback Structure
   - Chose structured format
   - Benefits: Consistent processing
   - Drawbacks: Less flexibility
   - Mitigation: Custom handlers

## Future Considerations

1. Performance
   - Batch processing
   - History compression
   - Feedback optimization

2. Features
   - Collaborative revision
   - Automated quality checks
   - Format conversion

3. Integration
   - External storage
   - Version control
   - Quality metrics
