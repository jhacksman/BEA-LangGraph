# Customer Service Router Design

## Design Principles

Following Anthropic's guidance on building effective agents:

1. Simplicity
   - Direct keyword-based classification
   - No complex state management
   - Clear routing logic

2. Separation of Concerns
   - Router only handles classification
   - Handlers manage specialized processing
   - Clear interfaces between components

3. Composability
   - Router can be used independently
   - Easy to extend with new routes
   - Simple integration with other components

## Implementation Details

### Router Configuration
```python
routes = {
    "technical": ["error", "bug", "not working"],
    "billing": ["charge", "payment", "refund"],
    "account": ["login", "password", "access"],
    "product": ["feature", "how to", "usage"]
}
```

### Design Decisions

1. Keyword-Based Routing
   - Pro: Simple and effective
   - Pro: Easy to maintain and update
   - Con: May miss context nuances
   - Mitigation: Careful keyword selection

2. Default Routing
   - Pro: No queries left unhandled
   - Pro: Clear fallback behavior
   - Con: Some queries may get generic handling
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive keyword coverage

3. Department Structure
   - Technical: System and application issues
   - Billing: Payment and subscription
   - Account: User access and management
   - Product: Usage and documentation
   - General: Catchall for other queries

## Future Considerations

1. Extensibility
   - Add new departments
   - Enhance keyword lists
   - Integrate with ML classification

2. Monitoring
   - Track routing accuracy
   - Measure department loads
   - Identify common queries

3. Integration
   - Connect with ticketing systems
   - Add response templates
   - Implement feedback loops
