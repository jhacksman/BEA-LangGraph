# Customer Service Routing Design

## Architecture Overview
```
Input -> Router -> Specialized Handler -> Response

Components:
- Router: Classifies customer queries
- Handlers: Specialized processors for each query type
- Integration Layer: Connects with external systems
```

## Design Decisions

1. Query Classification
   - Direct keyword matching for simplicity
   - No complex state management needed
   - Clear routing logic

2. Handler Specialization
   - Separate handlers for technical, billing, and general queries
   - Each handler optimized for its domain
   - Clear separation of concerns

3. Integration Points
   - Customer data access
   - Knowledge base integration
   - Ticket system connection
   - Payment system integration

## Trade-offs

1. Simplicity vs Sophistication
   - Chose simple keyword matching over ML classification
   - Benefits: Easy to maintain, debug, and extend
   - Drawbacks: May miss nuanced queries

2. Handler Separation
   - Benefits: Specialized handling, easier updates
   - Drawbacks: Some queries may cross boundaries

3. Default Handler
   - Benefits: No queries left unhandled
   - Drawbacks: Some queries may get generic responses

## Integration with Model Context Protocol

1. Tool Integration
   - Standardized tool interfaces
   - Clear documentation
   - Error handling patterns

2. Response Formatting
   - Consistent output structure
   - Clear error states
   - Proper think tag handling

## Future Considerations

1. Extensibility
   - Easy addition of new routes
   - Simple handler integration
   - Clear documentation requirements

2. Monitoring
   - Query classification accuracy
   - Handler performance
   - Error rates
