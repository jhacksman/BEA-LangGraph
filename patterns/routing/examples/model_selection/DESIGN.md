# Model Selection Routing Design

## Architecture Overview
```
Input -> Complexity Router -> Model Selection -> Response

Components:
- Router: Analyzes query complexity
- Model Selector: Chooses appropriate model
- Response Handler: Processes model output
```

## Design Decisions

1. Complexity Analysis
   - Keyword-based complexity assessment
   - Direct mapping to model capabilities
   - Clear selection criteria

2. Model Selection
   - Simple queries -> Smaller models (e.g., Claude 3.5 Haiku)
   - Complex queries -> Larger models (e.g., Claude 3.5 Sonnet)
   - Default to capable model when uncertain

3. Cost Optimization
   - Balance between capability and efficiency
   - Use smaller models when possible
   - Clear upgrade path for complex queries

## Trade-offs

1. Classification Approach
   - Benefits: Simple, predictable routing
   - Drawbacks: May not catch all complexity nuances

2. Default Model Selection
   - Benefits: Ensures quality responses
   - Drawbacks: Higher cost for ambiguous queries

3. Parallel Processing
   - Benefits: Can split complex tasks
   - Drawbacks: Increased total token usage

## Integration with Model Context Protocol

1. Model Interface
   - Standardized input/output formats
   - Consistent error handling
   - Clear capability documentation

2. Tool Integration
   - Common interface across models
   - Proper think tag handling
   - Clear documentation

## Future Considerations

1. Model Updates
   - Easy integration of new models
   - Clear capability documentation
   - Performance benchmarking

2. Monitoring
   - Classification accuracy
   - Cost optimization
   - Error rates
